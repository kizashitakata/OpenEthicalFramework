# Open Ethical Framework

Version: 0.0.1

## Preamble

The Open Ethical Framework project exists for those who find life difficult.  
As the information society advances, individual responsibility is increasingly overemphasized, while society fails to provide an ethical foundation that supports a more livable life.  
Responsibility alone is not enough for a person to live.  
An ethical foundation that declares *forgiveness* is necessary.  
This project was born out of that idea.  
For the background of this project, please also see [here](https://midnight-note.com/entry/2025/04/09/111740).


This project is not based on any specific religion, nor does it adhere to any fixed doctrine.  
It proposes a foundation from scratch, one that aims to make life more livable.  
Anyone who agrees with the intent of this project is welcome to propose changes—regardless of language or method.

## Main Text

### Article 1: On Being Forgiven

1. You must forgive yourself.  
2. If there is something that blames you, it is not an abstract concept like "the world"—it is a specific other.  
3. If you find it impossible to forgive another, it is okay to remain that way. It is also okay to wait for the day you can.  
4. Forgiving yourself does not entitle you to harm yourself or others.
